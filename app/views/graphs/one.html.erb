<h3>Import your file to produce a Pareto chart and a percentile chart. </h3>


<h4>Pareto Principle</h4>
The Pareto principle, also known as the 80-20 rule, states, “For many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes”.<br><br> 



This app helps you view the distribution of your data such as profits and sales and see which areas are most significant. You will then be able to decide which areas should be focused on in order to increase your business value.

2 Pareto charts will be produced.The first chart will be constructed based on your choice of X and Y axes. The second chart is a percentile chart 
that will show the distribution of your Y axis data, divided into ranges of 20% each.
